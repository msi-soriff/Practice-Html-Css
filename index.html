            <h3 class="text-decoration">HTML stand for Hyper Text Markup Language.The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML
                is the standard markup
                language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies
                such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
                into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
                included cues for the appearance of the document.

                HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such
                as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
                documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes
                and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as
                and directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as surround and
                provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not
                display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

                HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the
                behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The
                World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS
                standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</h3>

            <h2 class="tag-line">Description of CSS</h2>
            <h3 class="text-decoration">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the
                presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology
                of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
                fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
                specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the
                structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between
                the pages that share the file and its formatting.

                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
                styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
                or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if
                the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

                The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if
                more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

                The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME
                type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS
                validation service for CSS documents.[5]

                In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and
                XUL.</h3>
